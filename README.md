### Problem 
There are thirteen buildings in a colony in a specific order and there can be multiple
connectors among the buildings, and you have to color (there are four available colors) each
building such that the two adjacent building may not have the same color. Build a program by
selecting parameters as per your preference and make sure minimum number of colors are being
used.
